# Purpose:
Create a README.md file for AgentRX.  The README should provide an overview of the project, installation instructions,
usage examples, and any relevant documentation.

# agentrx seed idea
The idea of HR access is to provide a set of templates and tools for authentic coating that can coexist with the files/repo of a specific project, however that would work the best (git submodule, symbolic link, I am open to suggestions).
Ideally the agentrx files would be available "inside" a host project as `.agentrx`.
The "host" project can also reference files etc. in agentrx, e.g.: CLAUDE.md might point to claude/commands to add common commands to the host project.

Take your first crack at it.
