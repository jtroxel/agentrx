# Prompt: create_command_cli

Create /command + CLI code; `agentrx:prompt-do`. My command should optionally take a json data file or data as standard out from another command. Should also take an optional prompt file reference or select the most recent prompt file from a ARX_PROMPTS env var. A history flag will tell the command to append to a history log in a subdirectory of the ARX_PROMPTS.
