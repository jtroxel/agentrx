# Prompt: update_the_setup

Update the setup-agent-links script and `arx setup` command to also support Cursor and OpenCode, with an optional flag for those providers. In addition to creating links, the script should add or update the coding agent native files like .cursorrules. Create any other files necessary for compatibility with the _agents files. Prefer "wrapper files" to symbolic links wherever possible.
